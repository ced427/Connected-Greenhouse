  - `Greenhouse_Control.ino`: Main Arduino sketch for sensor readings and actuator controls.
- **Python/**: Contains scripts for data analysis and visualization.
  - `Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for sensor data analysis using Python.

### Documentation
- **Technical_Report.md**: Markdown version of the technical report, detailing project development and findings.
- **Technical_Report.pdf**: PDF version of the technical report for easy distribution and printing.
- **System_Architecture/**: Contains the updated system architecture diagrams.
  - `Updated_System_Architecture.pdf`: Detailed architecture diagrams of the project, created using Capella.
- **Project_Poster/**: Promotional materials for the project.
  - `Project_Poster.ppt`: PowerPoint file of the A3 project poster highlighting usage, technical, and CSR aspects.
  - `Project_Poster.pdf`: PDF version of the project poster.
